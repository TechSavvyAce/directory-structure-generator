# Directory Structure Generator  

## Description  
The Directory Structure Generator is a script that creates a nested folder structure for the years 2018 and 2019. Each year contains directories for each month, and each month contains directories for days. The script also generates random Git commits within these daily directories, with timestamps formatted in ISO 8601. This can be useful for testing or demonstration purposes.  

## Features  
- Creates a directory structure for 2018 and 2019.  
- Generates directories for each month and day.  
- Randomly commits files with unique timestamps to simulate a realistic Git history.
